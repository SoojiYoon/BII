The left frontal lobe has a peripheral enhancing mass of 4.8 cm in diameter, involving the basal ganglia and the insular area.
Minimal midline shifting.
Tumor infiltration or peritumoral edema with T2 hyperintensity in the genu and anterior body portions of the frontotemporal lobe, hypothalamus, and corpus callosum.
Enhancing portion shows high cellularity and increases permeability and perfusion.
There is necrosis and hemorrhagic change in the anterior portion.
Leptomeningeal enhancement is not seen.
All paranasal sinuses included in the scan have inflammation.'''

# S/P, Op., CCRT and chemotherapy for glioblastoma and GKS.
# 2015/3/29 Compared to brain MRI.
# Large irregular enhancing lesions in the anterior and superior aspect of the left temporal lobe tumorectomy sites were larger than before.
# In addition, there is a possibility of recurrent tumor because of the increased blood volume in the CBV map, and the possibility of treatment-related change can not be ruled out.
# The T2 high-signal intensity lesion in the left frontoparietotemporal lobe also increased in extent.
# Right frontal convexity with small meningioma does not change much.'''
